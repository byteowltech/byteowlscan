ByteOwlScan is a Python Package designed to extract structed information from a PDF, DOCX, IMAGE Curriculumn Vitae (CVs)/Resume documents. It leverages OCR technology and utilizes the capabilities of ChatGPT AI language model (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o-mini) to extract pieces of information from the CV content and organize them in a structured JSON-friendly format.

# Key Features
- Multi-format Support: Automatically handles resumes in PDF, DOCX, and image formats, ensuring seamless extraction across multiple sources.

- AI-Driven Parsing: Utilizes cutting-edge OpenAI models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o-mini) to accurately extract details such as personal information, education history, work experience, skills, certifications, and more.

- Image-to-Text Conversion: Employs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to convert text from scanned or photographed images of resumes.

- Comprehensive JSON Output: Produces well-structured JSON data that can easily be integrated into HR systems, recruitment workflows, or data analytics applications.

- High Accuracy and Context Awareness: Incorporates NLP techniques to understand context, ensuring the accuracy of extracted data even with complex resume layouts.

# Use Cases:

- HR Automation: Integrate into Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS) to automate resume screening and candidate data entry.

- Recruitment Platforms: Power recruitment tools with AI-driven extraction capabilities for enhanced candidate matching and analytics.

- Data Analytics: Collect resume data for insightful analysis of candidate trends and skills in the job market.

# Requirements
- Python: `Python 3.8 or newer`.

- `OpenAI API` You'll need OpenAI's API to extract information from content of CVs/Resumes. If you haven't API please go to [Platform OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) to register and get an API.

# How to Use

1. Prepare your CVs/Resumes with format `*.pdf, *.docx, *.png`.
2. Run the script: Run the following scripts, before run scripts, you need clone the project, prepare environment, and execute the code.

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byteowltech/byteowlscan
```

- Go to project directory

```bash
cd ByteOwlScan
```

- Run install package

```bash
pip install -e .
```

- Install requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Config openai api key => Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` to your openai api key

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

- Run script

```bash
python scripts/run_app.py --apiKey="<OPEN_API_KEY>" --config="<PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/config.yaml" --filePath="<PATH_TO_FILE_TO_SCAN>" --outputDir="<PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_TO_SAVE_RESULT>"
```

3. Examine the Results: After the script finishes, you will find the output in outputs‚Äù or your `outputDir` which JSON file is a result of the extracted information from CV/Resume.
